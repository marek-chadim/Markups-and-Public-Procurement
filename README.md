## Abstract:

This paper analyzes the effect of public procurement on firm markups, using a panel dataset
of Czech construction firms from 2006 to 2021. Markups are estimated through a structural
framework, while biases are addressed using a selection on observables design and models for
unobserved factors. Propensity score-based estimations indicate that firm markups increase by
approximately 15% during contract years. A temporal analysis, employing synthetic control
and matrix completion methods, reveals that treatment effects decline from around 30% in
2006 to 10% in 2021. These patterns are consistent with institutional improvements in the
Czech Republic and offer empirical evidence of increasing efficiency in public spending.

For my undergraduate thesis, I estimated production functions for firms in the Czech construction sector, addressing
endogeneity in productivity shocks and variable input usage using the control function approach and
GMM. A key contribution of this work was the creation of a novel dataset as well as the structural
inference of the markup distribution.
