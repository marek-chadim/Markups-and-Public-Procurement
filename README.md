### Master Thesis (in progress)

I employ a methodology that conditions on lagged outcome values (Xu and Imbens, 2024). In the data, firms entering public procurement in the current year already demonstrate higher markups in previous years, alongside larger sales, costs of goods sold, and capital. Using matched data, I balance these variables and conduct placebo tests, which confirm no effect on markups in the years before firms acquire government contracts. I also apply recent advances in causal panel data analysis. This section addresses (1) heterogeneity-robust estimators, (2) tests and sensitivity analyses for parallel trends, and (3) alternative identification strategies—including synthetic DID, interactive fixed effects, and matrix completion—drawing (Arkhangelsky and Imbens, 2024).

###  Submission: [The Young Economist Award of the Czech Economic Society](https://cse.cz/en/page/31st-young-economist-of-the-year-award)

Abstract:

I document the evolution of market power using firm-level data from the Czech construction
sector since 2006. Contrary to the global trend of rising markups, I find that aggregate markups
have decreased, declining from 40% above marginal cost in 2006 to 30% in 2021, driven primarily by firms in the upper tail of the markup distribution. By linking this data with government tenders, I examine the relationship between markups and public procurement. I find that
markups are significantly higher when controlling for unobserved productivity; government
contractors have price-to-marginal-cost ratios that are 0.3 higher than those of private-sector
firms; and firm-level markups increase by 12% upon a firm’s entry into public procurement.

### Bachelor's thesis, Charles University in Prague. doi: [dspace.cuni.cz](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/184831#xmluiArtifactToplinksNavigationhead_all_of_dspace_links)

Abstract:

This thesis analyses the relationship between engagement in public procurement and markups charged by firms. While controlling for aggregate trends
and individual firm characteristics, the effect is estimated in a multivariate
regression framework as the percentage markup premium associated with engagement in public procurement. This approach contributes to the existing literature on public procurement, in that, rather than only making comparisons
between different tenders, it benchmarks the competitiveness of public procurement against the competitiveness in markets serving private clients while not
having to rely on data on expert cost estimates.
