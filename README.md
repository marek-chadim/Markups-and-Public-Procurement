### Master Thesis 
For my master’s thesis, I aim to address selection bias in the average comparisons between private-sector-only
firms and government contractors. First, I assume that selection depends only on observable lagged
outcomes and pre-treatment covariates, within a trimmed sample with sufficient overlap in the
propensity score. Second, I control unobservable time-invariant confounders using recent causal panel
data methods. My analysis demonstrates a declining trend in the treatment effect for government
contractors, offering empirical evidence in favor of reforms aimed at curbing single-bidding practices and
reducing political favoritism in public procurement in the Czech Republic.

Abstract:

I document the evolution of market power using firm-level data from the Czech construction
sector since 2006. Contrary to the global trend of rising markups, I find that aggregate markups
have decreased, declining from 40% above marginal cost in 2006 to 30% in 2021, driven primarily by firms in the upper tail of the markup distribution. By linking this data with government tenders, I examine the relationship between markups and public procurement. I find that
markups are significantly higher when controlling for unobserved productivity; government
contractors have price-to-marginal-cost ratios that are 0.3 higher than those of private-sector
firms; and firm-level markups increase by 12% upon a firm’s entry into public procurement.

### Bachelor's thesis, Charles University in Prague. doi: [dspace.cuni.cz](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/184831#xmluiArtifactToplinksNavigationhead_all_of_dspace_links)

Abstract:

This thesis analyses the relationship between engagement in public procurement and markups charged by firms. While controlling for aggregate trends
and individual firm characteristics, the effect is estimated in a multivariate
regression framework as the percentage markup premium associated with engagement in public procurement. This approach contributes to the existing literature on public procurement, in that, rather than only making comparisons
between different tenders, it benchmarks the competitiveness of public procurement against the competitiveness in markets serving private clients while not
having to rely on data on expert cost estimates.
